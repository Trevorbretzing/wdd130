    <p class="p-product">We also understand that the modern rider needs clothing that can stand up to
        any condition, whether they are backcountry skiing or are just on the groomers of their local ski resort. We
        understand that the temperatures and conditions while skiing are unpredictable; that's why we use the most
        recent and cutting-edge technology to ensure that your ski trip won’t be ruined by a random storm. Our 100%
        waterproof design utilizes high-end fabrics to create a breathable jacket that won’t leave you sweating after a
        long day of riding. We also use 100% Eco friendly insulation material that offers superior warmth without the
        detrimental impacts of synthetic and fake insulation. Your SHRD jacket will be custom-built to fit you which
        means that it offers the best and highest performance to any rider. Because our jackets are hand made they offer
        the best protection and durability on the market today. If by chance your SHRD jacket breaks or tears we offer
        free replacements with any returned jacket. Your SHRD jackets and apparel are built to last.</p>
