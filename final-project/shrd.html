        Welcome to SHRDs official website!At SHRD we believe that sustainability and the ski community go hand in hand.
        Our main mission is to create high-quality and high-performance ski and snowboard gear that also has an
        environmentally positive impact. Whether you are a new skier experiencing the mountain for the first time or a
        high-performance pro-athlete SHRD is for YOU! Each piece of clothing is meticulously handcrafted using
        eco-friendly materials and sustainable manufacturing processes. The best part is that a portion of your purchase
        will go towards Forest preservation and wildfire prevention. Each and every single one of our products is
        created to be strong and durable but on the off chance that your SHRD apparel breaks tears or gets worn out, we
        offer free replacements so long as you return the jacket to us so we can recycle it properly. SHRD isnâ€™t just
        about clothing it is about ensuring our environment and mountains are just as beautiful and pristine for future
        generations of little shredders!
