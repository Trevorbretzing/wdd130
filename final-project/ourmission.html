        With SHRD, you will be able to redefine what it means to ride responsibly. SHRD is driven by our purpose of
        creating environmentally friendly, yet stylish snowboarding apparel. The mountains we SHRED are in danger from
        toxic chemicals and microplastics being released into our atmosphere. When you SHRED with SHRD, you know you
        have done your part in protecting our environment. When you use SHRD, you know that what you are wearing is made
        from high-quality fabrics created from recycled polyester, organic cotton, and other eco-friendly materials.
        Although we can't create our product without having a carbon footprint, we promise to offset the carbon
        footprint of our operations by investing in projects that restore forests, promote renewable energy, and support
        other environmental initiatives. Our mission is to preserve these beautiful mountains we enjoy and love for the
        people of tomorrow. If you join us and ride SHRD, know that you have done your part in creating a more
        sustainable and environmentally friendly ski and snowboarding community. One way you can help us on our journey
        is by returning your damaged or worn jackets to us. In return, we will offer you a free replacement.
