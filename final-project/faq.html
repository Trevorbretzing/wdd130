        <h1 class="FAQ">FAQ</h1>
        <h2 class="h-FAQ">What materials do you use in your apparel?</h2>
        <p class="p-FAQ">
            At SHRD, we are committed to using only the highest quality eco-friendly materials. Our apparel is crafted
            from sustainable fabrics like recycled polyester, which helps reduce waste and lower environmental impact.
            We also use organic cotton, grown without harmful pesticides or chemicals, ensuring that our clothing is
            both comfortable and eco-conscious. Additionally, we explore other innovative, sustainable materials that
            further contribute to the reduction of our carbon footprint, making each piece of gear not only stylish but
            environmentally responsible.

        <h2 class="h-FAQ">How should I care for my SHRD gear?</h2>
        <p class="p-FAQ"> To ensure that your SHRD gear lasts for many seasons, we recommend taking good care of it.
            When washing, always use cold water to conserve energy and avoid damaging the fabrics. For drying, air
            drying is the best method to maintain the integrity of the eco-friendly materials we use. We suggest
            avoiding fabric softeners or bleach, as these chemicals can degrade the fabrics and harm the environment. By
            following these simple care instructions, you’ll help extend the life of your apparel while keeping it
            eco-friendly.</p>
        <h2 class="h-FAQ"> Do you offer a product warranty?</h2>
        <p class="p-FAQ"> Yes, SHRD stands behind the quality of our products. We offer a warranty against manufacturing
            defects, ensuring that your gear is free from flaws when you receive it. If you experience any issues such
            as stitching problems, faulty zippers, or any defects that arise from normal use, simply contact our
            customer service team. We’ll work with you to resolve the issue, whether that’s providing a replacement or
            offering a repair. Our goal is to keep you happy and comfortable in your SHRD gear for years to come.</p>
        <h2 class="h-FAQ">How can I reduce my environmental impact when buying SHRD?</h2>
        <p class="p-FAQ"> By choosing SHRD, you’re already taking a positive step toward a more sustainable future. Our
            products are designed with eco-friendly materials and ethical production practices in mind. However, you can
            further reduce your environmental impact by recycling or returning worn-out items. If your gear becomes
            damaged or no longer serves you, we offer a program where you can send it back for recycling, and we’ll
            replace it with a new product. This helps minimize waste and allows us to keep our environmental impact as
            low as possible while encouraging a circular economy.
